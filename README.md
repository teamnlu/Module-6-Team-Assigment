Module 6 Team Project number 2
# This is a project to randonmly select a number between 0 and 10. If you guess the incorrect number then the project will ask for a new input from the user. If you select the correct number the project will allow you to win or complete the project.

Module 6 introduces us to a lot of modules available already included in Python. Your team is to write a guessing program that will take a number (input) from the user and guess a randomly generated number. Provide the user with an opportunity to guess higher or lower, depending on the randomly generated number. Remember to use python module(s) and nested ifâ€¦else statements in your code.

A sample output from your code should look as follows:

Or

Extra credit:

The team can modify the program so that it continues looping allowing the user to keep guessing a number until the user chooses the 'No' option using a prompt (i.e. 'Would you like to guess another number (Y/N)?'. In this version, the program should only terminate when the user selects 'N'.
